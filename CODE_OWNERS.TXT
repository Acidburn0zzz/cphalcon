This file is a list of the people responsible for ensuring that patches for a
particular part of Phalcon are reviewed, either by themselves or by someone
else. They are also the gatekeepers for their part of Phalcon, with the final
word on what goes in or not.

The list is sorted by last name and formatted to allow easy grepping and
beautification by scripts.  The fields are: name (N), email (E), web-address
(W), PGP key ID and fingerprint (P), description (D), and snail-mail address
(S).

Sample of querying command:
  cat CODE_OWNERS.TXT | awk -v RS='' -v ORS='\n\n' '/Volt/'
